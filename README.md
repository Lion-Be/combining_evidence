# combining_evidence

Much attention has been given to the question of how to quantify evidence for informative (inequality
constrained) hypotheses. In a Bayesian framework, the current state-of-the-art assesses such with Bayes factors comparing the performance of competing hypotheses against each other. As in recent years, calls for replication studies are rising and researchers increasingly aim to evaluate informative hypotheses using multiple studies, the question of how to combine/aggregate evidence from these
measures is of high importance. Aggregated measures need to provide valid results even if evidence from different study designs, models and measurements are combined. 

Through a variety of simulation studies, this project assesses how powerful Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities are in detecting the true hypothesis if multiple studies yielding congruent or mixed results are combined.
